# Ganymede

An [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app providing a lightweight wrapper around [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to turn it into a desktop application.
This is not an official part of the Jupyter project; anything good about this is thanks to them and any bugs are thanks to me!
